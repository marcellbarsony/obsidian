# Crawling

[Web Crawling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)
(*or web spidering*) is an automated technique
used to systematically browse the web and extract important data
(*e.g., links, metadata, sensitive files, comments, etc.*)

<!-- Methodology {{{-->
## Methodology

### Breadth-First

**Breadth-First Crawling** prioritizes exploring a website's width
before its depth.

**Breadth-First Crawling** starts crawling all the links on the seed page,
then moves on to the links on those pages.

### Depth-First

**Depth-First Crawling** prioritizes exploring a website's depth
before its width.

**Depth-First Crawling** follows a single path of links as far as possible
before backtracking nd exploring other paths.
