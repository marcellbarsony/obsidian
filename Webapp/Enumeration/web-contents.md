## Autocompletion

Check if `autocomplete` is disabled

```html
autocomplete="off"
```

Setting `autocomplete="off"` on input fields has two effects:

- It tells the browser not to save data inputted by the user for later
  autocompletion
- It stops the browser from caching form data in the session history
