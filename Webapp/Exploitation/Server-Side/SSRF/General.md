# Server-Side Request Forgery

**Server-Side Request Forgery**
(*[SSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_request_forgery)*)
enables an attacker to manipulate a web application into sending requests
from the vulnerable server to internal or external systems or the server itself

**SSRF** occurs when a web application fetches additional resources
from a remote location based on user-supplied data
(*e.g, a URL*)

- `http://` and `https://`: These URL schemes fetch content via HTTP/S requests.
  An attacker might use this in the exploitation of SSRF vulnerabilities to bypass WAFs,
  access restricted endpoints, or access endpoints in the internal network

- `file://`: This URL scheme reads a file from the local file system.
  An attacker might use this in the exploitation of SSRF vulnerabilities
  to read local files on the web server ([[LFI]])

- `gopher://`: This protocol can send arbitrary bytes to the specified address.
  An attacker might use this in the exploitation of SSRF vulnerabilities
  to send [[Networking/Services/HTTP/General#POST|HTTP POST]] requests with arbitrary payloads
  or communicate with other services (*e.g, SMTP servers, databases*)
