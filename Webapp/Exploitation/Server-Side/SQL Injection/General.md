# SQL Injection

[SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications,
in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field
for execution (*e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker*)

<!-- Databases {{{-->
## Databases

Backend database structures (*Database Management Systems*)
used to store and retrieve data related to the web applicaiton

<!-- Tip {{{-->
> [!tip]- DBMS Features
>
>
> | Feature  | Description |
> | -------- | ----------- |
> | Concurrency | A real-world application might have multiple users interacting with it simultaneously. A DBMS makes sure that these concurrent interactions succeed without corrupting or losing any data. |
> | Consistency | With so many concurrent interactions, the DBMS needs to ensure that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the database. |
> | Security | DBMS provides fine-grained security controls through user authentication and permissions. This will prevent unauthorized viewing or editing of sensitive data. |
> | Reliability | It is easy to backup databases and rolls them back to a previous state in case of data loss or a breach. |
> | Structured Query Language | SQL simplifies user interaction with the database with an intuitive syntax supporting various operations. |

1. **Tier 1**: Client side application

The user sends a HTTP(S) Request

2. **Tier 2**: Application server (*middleware*)

The backend interprets the request and
issue queries to the database

3. Database Management system

The database performs the requested operation
and constructs a response
(*e.g., insertion, retrieval, deletion, updating*)

<!-- Reational Databases {{{-->
### Reational Databases

**Relational Databases** utilize SQL
and use a schema (*template*)
to dictate the stored data structure

Relational Databases using a key
(*relational database management system (RDBMS)*)
to link one table to another

The relationship between tables within a database is called a Schema

<!-- Non-Relational Databases {{{-->
### Non-Relational Databases

**Non-Relational Databases** (*NoSQL databases*)
utilize a variety of methods for communications

NoSQL databases doesn't use tables, rows, columns,
or prime keys, relationships and schemas

NoSQL database stores data using various storage models,
depending on the type of data stored

- Key-Value (*e.g., json, xml*)
- Document-Based
- Wide-Column
- Graph

<!-- Example {{{-->
> [!example]-
>
> Key-Value model
>
> ```json
> {
>   "100001": {
>     "date": "01-01-2021",
>     "content": "Welcome to this web application."
>   },
>   "100002": {
>     "date": "02-01-2021",
>     "content": "This is the first post on this web app."
>   },
>   "100003": {
>     "date": "02-01-2021",
>     "content": "Reminder: Tomorrow is the ..."
>   }
> }
> ```

<!-- Prevention {{{-->
## Prevention

SQL injections are usually caused by poorly coded web applications
or poorly secured back-end server and databases privileges
