# Access Control

**Access Control**
(*[OWASP TOP 10 2025 - A01 Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/A01_2025-Broken_Access_Control/)*)
is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized
to perform actions or access resources

**Access Control** is dependent on authentication and session management:

- **Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are
- **Session Management** identifies which subsequent HTTP requests
  are being made by that same user
- **Access Control** determines whether the user is allowed
  to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform
