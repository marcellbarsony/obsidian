# Path Traversal

**Path Traversal Attack**
(*[Directory Traversal Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack)*)
of user-supplied file names
— such that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" (`../`) —
are passed through to the operating system's file system API.

**Path Traversal** vulnerabilities enable an attacker
to read arbitrary files (*outside the [[Web Server Root]]*)
on the server that is running an application

- Application code and data
- Credentials for back-end systems
- Sensitive operating system files

<!-- Mitigation {{{-->
## Mitigation

To mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities,
developers should never blindly trust user-supplied inputs
that could potentially interact with the file system API,
and must implement robust validation techniques

- Input sanitization
- Directory whitelisting
- Path canonicalization
- Limiting permissions (*least privilege principle*)

<!-- Example {{{-->
> [!example]-
>
> Java code to validate the canonical path of a file based on user input
>
> ```java
> File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);
> if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) {
>     // process file
> }
> ```
