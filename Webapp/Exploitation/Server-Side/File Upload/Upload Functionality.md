# Upload Functionality

If the user input and uploaded files
are not correctly filtered and validated,
attackers may be able to exploit the file upload feature
to perform malicious activities
(*e.g, executing arbitrary commands on the back-end server*)

[Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)
allows any unauthenticated user to upload any file type
