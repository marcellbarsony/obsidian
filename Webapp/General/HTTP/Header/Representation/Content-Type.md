# Content-Type

The HTTP [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type)
representation header
is used to indicate the original media type of a resource
before any content encoding is applied

The **Content-Type** header is set by the browser on the client side,
by usually deriving it from the file extension

```sh
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```
