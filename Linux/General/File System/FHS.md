# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

The **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard** ([FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard))
defines the directory structure and directory contents in Linux distributions.

## Directory Structure

Basic Linux FHS directory structure

## FHS Compliance

Most Linux distributions follow the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard** and
declare it their own policy to maintain FHS compliance.
