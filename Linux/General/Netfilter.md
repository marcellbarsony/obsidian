# Netfilter

[Netfilter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter)
is a Linux kernel module that allows network-related operations
(*e.g., packet filtering, network address translation,
and other tools relevant to firewalls*)


The **Netfilter** kernel module has three main functions:

1. Packet defragmentation
2. Connection tracking
3. Network Address Translation ([[NAT]])
