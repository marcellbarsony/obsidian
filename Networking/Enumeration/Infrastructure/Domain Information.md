# Domain Information

## Subdomain Discovery

### SSL Certificate

Get SSL Certificate

```sh
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .
```

Get SSL Certificate & Filter by unique subdomains

```sh
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=<example.com>\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -ucurl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=<example.com>\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```

Identify hosts directly accessible from the Internet

```sh
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep <example.com> | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
```

### Shodan

The hosts then can be investigated further with
[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), that finds devices and systems connected to
the Internet: it searches for open TCP/IP ports, filters the systems to specific
criteria, and finds devices and systems (e.g., IoT).

```sh
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
```

```sh
for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
```
