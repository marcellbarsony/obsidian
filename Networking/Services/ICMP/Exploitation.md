# Exploitation

### ICMP Redirect Attacks

[ICMP Redirect messages](https://hackviser.com/tactics/pentesting/services/icmp#icmp-redirect-attacks)
can be exploited to manipulate a host's routing table and redirect its traffic
through an attacker-controlled device

```sh
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects
```

### ICMP Flood Attacks

[ICMP Flood attacks](https://hackviser.com/tactics/pentesting/services/icmp#icmp-flood-attacks)
involve overwhelming a target host with a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests

```sh
hping3 --flood --icmp <target_ip>
```

### Ping Of Death

A [Ping Of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death) is a type of
attack that involves sending malformed ping to a computer: A host sends hundreds
of ping requests with a packet size that is large or illegal to another host to
try take it offline.

A correctly formed ping packet is

- **56 bytes** in size
- **64 bytes** with the ICMP header
- **84 bytes** with the IP header

Any [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) packets (including pings) can be
as large as 65,535 bytes.

Some computer systems were never designed to handle a ping packet larger than
the maximum packet size as it violates the
[Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol).

When the target computer reassembles the malformed packet, a buffer overflow can
occur.
