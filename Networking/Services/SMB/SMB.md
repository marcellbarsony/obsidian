# Server Message Block (SMB)

The **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol, operating in a client-server model,
is designed for sharing files, directories, and other resources like printers
and routers over a network.

## Port 139

The **Network Basic Input Output System (NetBIOS)** is a software protocol
designed to enable applications, PCs, and Desktops within a local area network
(LAN) to interact with network hardware and facilitate the transmission of data
across the network.

## Port 445

The **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol operates over port 445 to provide
shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network.
Unlike NetBIOS-based communication (on port 139), SMB over port 445 allows
direct TCP/IP transport without relying on the NetBIOS layer, enabling more
efficient and modern file sharing and remote administration within local area
networks (LANs) and across domain environments.
