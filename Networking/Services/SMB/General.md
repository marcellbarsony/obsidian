# SMB

**SMB** ([Server Message Block](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb/f210069c-7086-4dc2-885e-861d837df688))
is a client-server protocol over TCP, designed for sharing files, directories,
and other resources (*e.g., printers, routers, interfaces*) over a network.

<!-- NetBIOS (Port 139) {{{-->
## NetBIOS (Port 139)

The [[Networking/Services/NetBIOS/General|NetBIOS]] is a software protocol
designed to enable applications, PCs, and Desktops within a LAN to interact with
network hardware and facilitate the transmission of data across the network.

<!-- SMB (Port 445) {{{-->
## SMB (Port 445)

The **SMB** protocol operates over **port 445** to provide shared access to
files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network.

**SMB** over TCP port `445` allows direct TCP/IP transport without relying on
the NetBIOS layer (over TCP port `139`), enabling more efficient and modern file
sharing and remote administration within LANs and across domain environments.

<!-- Samba {{{-->
## Samba

**[Samba](https://www.samba.org/)** is an alternative implementation of the
**SMB server** developed for Unix-based operating systems, that implements the
Common Internet File System ([CIFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e))
network protocol (*often referred as SMB/CIFS*).

<!-- Service {{{-->
### Service

Display the Samba server's status

```
sudo smbstatus
```

Restart the SMB service (*required on configuration change*)

```sh
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

<!-- RPC {{{-->
## RPC

The **Remote Procedure Call** ([RPC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/))
is a way for a program to run a function on another computer in a network
as if it were local.

1. The client sends a request (with arguments) to the server
2. The server executes the function
3. The server sends back the results

<!-- Configuration {{{-->
### Configuration

[smb.conf](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html) â€”
The configuration file for the Samba suite is located at `/etc/samba/smb.conf`

To apply changes in the configuration, the service daemon must be restarted

<!-- Default Configuration {{{-->
#### Default Configuration

Default configuration parameters and values

Global settings are defined under the `[global]` share, and can be overwritten
in individual shares (e.g., `[printers]`, `[print$]`, etc.).
