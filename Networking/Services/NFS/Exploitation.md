# Exploitation

<!-- Trusting UID and GID {{{-->
## Trusting UID and GID

It is possible to impersonate `root` (`UID` 0) if `no_root_squash` is enabled.

- Mount a directory which contains files or directories only accessible by some
  user (by `UID`). Then, create locally a user with the same UID and use that
  user to access the file/directory.

- The tool [fuse_nfs](https://github.com/hvs-consulting/nfs-security-tooling)
  will basically send always needed `UID` and `GID` to access the files

<!-- NSFShell {{{-->
## NSFShell

List, mount and change `UID` and `GID` to have access to files with
[nfsshell](https://github.com/Supermathie/nfsshell)
