# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

**[Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol)**
is an [Internet Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard)
protocol for collecting information about managed network devices on IP
networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior.

## SNMP Versions

### Version 1 & 2c

In SNMP versions `1` and `2c`, access is controlled using a
**plaintext community string**, and if the name is known,
access can be gained to it.

### Version 3

**Encryption** and **authentication** were only added in SNMP version `3`.
