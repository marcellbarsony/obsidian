<!-- SSH {{{-->
# SSH

**SSH** ([Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell))
is a client-server model network protocol that allows a secure way to acces a
computers remotely via password authentication or passwordless
[[#Public Key Authentication]].

<!-- Public Key Authentication {{{-->
## Public Key Authentication

[SSH Public Key Authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication)
uses [asymmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
with a [[#Private Key]] and a corresponding [[#Public Key]].

Prior to the authentication process:

1. The user generates a key pair

2. The [[#Public Key]] is copied to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

During the authentication process:

1. Client initiate SSH connection to the server

2. Server sends a cryptographic challenge based on the stored [[#Public Key]]

3. Client signs the challenge with its [[#Private Key]]

4. Server verifies the signature using the [[#Public Key]]

<!-- Key Pairs {{{-->
### Key Pairs

#### Private Key

The **private key** is generated and stored locally,
and often secured with a passphrase.

Possession of the private key allows a user to authenticate themselves
to a server that recognizes the matching public key.

#### Public Key

The **public key** is copied to the SSH server(s).
Anyone with a copy of the public key can encrypt data which can be
be decrypted by the server(s).

If a server receives a public key from a trustworthy user,
it marks the key as authorized in its [authorized_keys file](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-keys-file)
as an [authorized key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-key).

<!-- Configuration {{{-->
## Configuration

<!-- Default Configuration {{{-->
### Default Configuration

The [sshd config](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config) file has only
a few settings configured by default

> [!example]-
>
> ```sh
> cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
> ```
> ```sh
> Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
> ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
> UsePAM yes
> X11Forwarding yes
> PrintMotd no
> AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
> Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
> ```

<!-- Dangerous Settings {{{-->
### Dangerous Settings

Misconfigurations can make the SSH server vulnerable to attacks
