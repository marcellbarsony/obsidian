## Offline Hash Cracking

During the authentication process, the server sends a salted
[SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) or
[MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)
hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place.

There is no direct "fix" to this issue because the flaw is a critical component
of the [[General|IPMI]] specification.

<!-- Tip {{{-->
> [!tip]
>
> Clients can opt for
> - a very long, difficult to crack passwords
> - implement network segmentation rules
>   to restrict the direct access to the [[General#BMC|BMC]]s
<!-- }}} -->

The [[Enumeration#Dumping Hashes|dumped password hashes]] can be cracked offline
[[Hashcat]] mode `7300`

<!-- Example {{{-->
> [!example]
>
> > [!todo]

> ```sh
> hashcat

<!-- }}} -->

HP iLO [[General#Dangerous Settings|default password]] can be cracked with

```sh
hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u
```

<!-- Tip {{{-->
> [!tip]
>
> It should be possible to
> - [[Networking/Services/SSH/General|SSH]] into the many critical servers
>   as the `root` user
> - And gain access to the web management consoles for various network
>   monitoring tools
