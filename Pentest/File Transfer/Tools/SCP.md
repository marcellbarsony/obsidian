# Secure Copy Protocol

**Secure Copy Protocol**
(*[SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol)*)
allows to transfer files securely between a local host and a remote host
or between two remote hosts.

It is based on the Secure Shell ([[SSH/General|SSH]) protocol

<!-- Warning {{{-->
> [!warning]
>
> According to OpenSSH developers in April 2019,
> SCP is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed;
> they recommend the use of more modern protocols like
> SFTP and rsync for file transfer
