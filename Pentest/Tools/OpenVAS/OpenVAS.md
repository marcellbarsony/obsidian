# OpenVAS

[OpenVAS](https://openvas.org/)
(*Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner,
originally known as GNessUs*)
is a full-featured vulnerability scanner.

**OpenVAS** is the scanner component of
Greenbone Vulnerability Management (*GVM*),
a software framework of several services and tools
offering vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management

**OpenVAS**'s capabilities include
- unauthenticated and authenticated testing
- various high-level and low-level internet and industrial protocols
- performance tuning for large-scale scans
- a powerful internal programming language
  to implement any type of vulnerability test

<!-- Scan Configurations {{{-->
> [!info]- Scan Configurations
>
> - **Base**: Enumerate information about the host's status
>   and operating system information (*does not check vulnerabilities*)
> - **Discovery**: Enumerate information about the system
>   (*e.g., host's services, hardware, accessible ports,
>   and software being used on the system*)
> - **Host Discovery**: Test whether the host is alive
>   and determines what devices are active on the network
>   (*e.g., ping*)
> - **System Discovery**: Enumerate the target host further than 'Discovery Scan'
>   and attempts to identify the operating system and hardware
>   associated with the host
> - **Full and fast**: Recommended by OpenVAS as the safest option
>   and leverages intelligence to use the best NVT checks for the host(s)
>   based on the accessible ports
