# Stegsnow

[Stegsnow](https://darkside.com.au/snow/)
is a tool for concealing messages in text files
by appending tabs and whitespaces at the end of lines.

Because spaces and tabs are generally not visible in text viewers,
the message is effectively hidden from casual observers.

If the built-in encryption is used,
the message cannot be read even if it is detected

> With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
