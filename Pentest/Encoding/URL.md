# URL Encoding

[URL Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)
(*also known as percent encoding*)
is a method to encode arbitrary data in a uniform resource identifier
(*[URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)*)
using only the US-ASCII characters legal within a URI.

**Percent-encoding** is used to ensure special characters
do not interfere with the URI's structure and interpretation.

Special characters are replaced with a percent sign (`%`)
followed by two hexadecimal digits
representing the character's byte value.

<!-- Example {{{-->
> [!example]

> A space is commonly encoded as `%20`

> ```sh
> http://example.com/my file.txt

> ```sh
> http://example.com/my%20file.txt
> ```

Although it is known as URL encoding,
it is also used more generally within the main Uniform Resource Identifier
(*[URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)*) set,
which includes both Uniform Resource Locator (*URL*)
and Uniform Resource Name (*URN*)

Consequently, it is also used in the preparation of data
of the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
[media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type),
as is often used in the submission of HTML form data in HTTP requests

Percent-encoding is not case-sensitive
