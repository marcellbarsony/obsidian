# Encoding

[Double Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_encoding)
is the act of encoding data twice in a row
using the same encoding scheme.
It is usually used as an attack technique
to bypass authorization schemes or security filters
that intercept user input.

In double encoding attacks against security filters,
characters of the payload that are treated as illegal
by those filters are replaced with their double-encoded form.

Double URI-encoding is a special type of double encoding
in which data is URI-encoded twice in a row.
It has been used to bypass authorization schemes
and security filters against code injection,
directory traversal, cross-site scripting (*XSS*) and SQL injection
