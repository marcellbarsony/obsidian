# Strings

In C, stings are arrays of characters stored in contiguous memory locations,
terminated by a null character (`\0`).

- **Character Array**: Strings are stored as a contiguous array of characters
- **Null-Termination**: The `\0` at the end marks the end of the string,
  distinguishing it from a regular character array
- **Fixed Size**: The maximum length of a string is set when the character
  array is declared
