# Bash

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
is an interactive command interpreter and scripting language
developed for Unix-like operating systems.

Created in 1989 by Brian Fox for the GNU Project,
it is designed as a completely free software alternative
for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell),
`sh`, and other proprietary Unix shells,
supported by the Free Software Foundation
