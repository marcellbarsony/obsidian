# Highlight

Some Markdown processors allows text highlighting - GitHub does not!

To highlight words, use two equal signs (==) before and after the words.
```
These ==important words== must be highlighted.
```

### Rendered output

These ==important words== must be highlighted.

## HTML syntax

Alternatively, HTML tags (`<mark>`) can be used if the Markdown application
supports them.
```
These <mark>important words</mark> must be highlighted.
```

These <mark>important words</mark> must be highlighted.
