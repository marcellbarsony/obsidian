# Match

```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 13;

    println!("Tell me about {}", number);
    match number {
        // Single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Several values
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
        // Inclusive range
        13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
        // Handle the rest of cases
        _ => println!("Ain't special"),
    }

    let boolean = true;
    let binary = match boolean {
        false => 0,
        true => 1,
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", boolean, binary);

### Tuple

```rs

        (1, ..)  => println!("First is `1`, the rest doesn't matter"),
        (.., 2)  => println!("Last is `2`, the rest doesn't matter"),
        (3, .., 4)  => println!("First is `3`, last is `4`, the rest doesn't matter"),
        _      => println!("Don't bind the value to a variable"),

<!-- Arrays/Slices {{{-->
```rs

        // Single values are ignored with _
        [1, _, third] => println!(

<!-- Pointers/ref {{{-->
